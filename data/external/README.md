# External Data

Place optional external football datasets here.

## Understat xG

Save the Understat/Kaggle match or game stats CSV as:

```text
data/external/understat_matches.csv
```

Or refresh it directly from Understat:

```bash
python src/update_understat.py
```

Supported schemas:

- Match-level rows with columns like `date`, `league`, `team_h`, `team_a`, `h_xg`, `a_xg`
- Team-per-match rows with columns like `date`, `league`, `club_name`, `home_away`, `xG`

CSV and Parquet files in this directory are ignored by Git.

## Pre-Match Match Context

Save optional lineups, injuries, suspensions, manager changes, and weather as:

```text
data/external/match_context.csv
```

The pipeline joins rows by `date`, `league`, `home_team`, and `away_team`. The data must be information available before kickoff; do not add post-match stats.

Supported columns:

- Required keys: `date`, `league`, `home_team`, `away_team`
- Lineups: `lineup_available`, `home_lineup_strength`, `away_lineup_strength`
- Team news: `team_news_available`, `home_absence_count`, `away_absence_count`, `home_injury_count`, `away_injury_count`, `home_suspension_count`, `away_suspension_count`, `home_key_absence_count`, `away_key_absence_count`
- Manager changes: `home_manager_change_recent`, `away_manager_change_recent`, or `home_manager_change_days`, `away_manager_change_days`
- Weather: `weather_available`, `temperature_c`, `wind_kph`, `precipitation_mm`

Example:

```csv
date,league,home_team,away_team,lineup_available,home_lineup_strength,away_lineup_strength,team_news_available,home_injury_count,away_injury_count,home_suspension_count,away_suspension_count,home_key_absence_count,away_key_absence_count,home_manager_change_recent,away_manager_change_recent,weather_available,temperature_c,wind_kph,precipitation_mm
2024-08-16,england,Man United,Fulham,1,0.94,0.88,1,2,4,0,1,1,2,0,0,1,18.5,12.0,0.4
```

### Weather Refresh

Weather can be filled from Open-Meteo historical hourly weather. First create:

```text
data/external/team_locations.csv
```

with one row per home team:

```csv
league,team,latitude,longitude
england,Arsenal,51.5549,-0.1084
england,Man United,53.4631,-2.2913
```

You can generate the exact team skeleton from the local raw match files:

```bash
python src/update_weather_context.py --write-location-template
```

Then run:

```bash
python src/update_weather_context.py --start-season 2023 --end-season 2024
```

The script writes weather fields into `match_context.csv` and reports any missing teams in `data/external/missing_team_locations.csv`.

### API-Football Lineups and Injuries

API-Football can fill the team-news columns from the free plan, but the free quota is small. The updater caches every API response in:

```text
data/external/api_football_cache/
```

Set your key in the shell:

```bash
set API_FOOTBALL_KEY=your_key_here
```

PowerShell:

```powershell
$env:API_FOOTBALL_KEY="your_key_here"
```

Then fetch the next local fixture window:

```bash
python update_team_news.py
```

This simple command fetches injuries/suspensions for the next 7 days and writes `match_context.csv`. Useful quota-safe options:

- `--lineups`: also try confirmed lineups near kickoff.
- `--max 20`: cap the number of fixture-detail calls in one run.
- `--pause 6.5`: seconds between API calls; the simple script defaults to this to avoid free-plan rate limits.
- `--cache-only`: rebuild `match_context.csv` from cached API responses without spending calls.
- `--dry-run`: print the rows without writing `match_context.csv`.

For slow historical backfill, use a narrow date range and include played matches:

```bash
python update_team_news.py --from-date 2024-08-01 --to-date 2024-08-31 --played --max 40
```

For the API-Football free plan, the current 2025-2026 season may be blocked. Use the built-in free historical training mode instead:

```bash
python update_team_news.py --free-training
```

This targets API seasons 2022-2024 and skips rows that are already present in `match_context.csv`, so you can rerun it later without repeating the same fixture-detail calls.

For a specific leakage-safe backtest, prefer the targeted mode. Example: backtest `--season 2023` needs validation 2022-2023 and test 2023-2024 context:

```bash
python update_team_news.py --backtest-season 2023 --max 10
```

This targets the test period by default. To fill the validation period too:

```bash
python update_team_news.py --backtest-season 2023 --period validation --max 10
```

If API-Football returns HTTP 429, wait and continue with a smaller batch:

```bash
python update_team_news.py --free-training --max 10
```

The importer writes `lineup_available`, lineup completeness, injury counts, suspension counts, absence counts, and trace columns such as `api_football_fixture_id`. It does not invent player quality ratings; `home_lineup_strength` and `away_lineup_strength` are lineup completeness scores unless a richer licensed source is added later.
